## 📌 Project Overview

With the growing complexity of online shopping and travel booking, consumers often face difficulty comparing prices across various platforms. Our solution addresses this challenge by offering an integrated platform that:

- Collects and consolidates data from multiple sources
- Provides real-time and historical pricing information
- Delivers intelligent insights through machine learning
- Visualizes key trends via dynamic dashboards

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer         | Technology Used          |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| **Frontend**  | Angular 15+ (Standalone Components) |
| **Backend**   | Flask (Python, REST API) |
| **Database**  | Microsoft SQL Server |
| **ETL**       | Talend Open Studio |
| **BI Layer**  | Power BI |
| **Dev Tools** | VS Code, XAMPP, GitHub |

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🛒 **Product Price Comparison** (Carrefour, MG, Géant)
- 🏨 **Hotel Price Scraper** (Kayak)
-✈️ **Flight Price Scraper**
- 🧠 **ML Models**: Clustering, Regression, Recommendation, Time Series Forecasting
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards** (Power BI)
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access** for different users
- 📦 **Real-time Data Integration** using ETL pipelines (Talend)

---

## 🧪 Machine Learning Integration

We implemented several models using Python:

- **Clustering** to group pricing behavior
- **Regression** for price prediction
- **Hybrid Recommendation System** for personalized suggestions
- **Time Series Analysis (SARIMA)** for future trend forecasting

All models are serialized and integrated into the Flask backend for real-time access.

## 🛠️ How to Run the Project Locally

### 🔹 Backend (Flask)
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to `/backend`.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment.
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### 🔹 Frontend (Angular)
1. Navigate to `/frontend`.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

> **Note**: The Angular app uses a proxy to route API calls to Flask.
